                    Cedar and Alder plank cooking was created by Northwest Native Americans. They would tie fish and game to large Western red
                    cedar or alder planks. They would then place the planks around open fires, and the residual heat from
                    the fire would cook the fish or game.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This cooking procedure was done for hundreds of years, more out of a necessity for a cooking surface than anything else.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the late 1990’s I started experimenting with cooking planks. While developing the menu for Palisade Restaurant I was introduced
                    to baking planks. I was intrigued by this method of cooking as it gave us a tie to the Northwest Native
                    Americans and was a simple yet flavorful and healthy way to cook.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Salmon was the first recipe I created for plank cooking. Chef Garrett Cho and I worked on perfecting a great salmon recipe
                    which we eventually placed on the opening menu for Palisade-it quickly became one of the bestselling
                    entrées.

                    Phil came to me and asked me to create a cookbook for him. So my family and I ate from cedar and alder
                    baking planks for months, until I had enough great recipes to make the Cedar Plank Cookbook-or the blue

                <p>
                    <strong>Baking Planks</strong> – The benefits of using baking planks are many. They impart subtle wood flavors,
                    and they maintain the natural juices in the meats and vegetables that are cooked on the plank, making
                    for moist flavorful foods. They are easy to use and because they maintain the natural moisture you don’t
                    need to add other fats, such as butter; but of course you still can if you want. Our baking planks come
                    in two different woods-both Western red cedar and alder. The cedar is a little more aromatic and adds
                    a stronger woodsy flavor to the foods that are cooked on it. The alder is milder and sweeter, with a
                    very subtle flavor.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The baking planks are designed to be used in your home oven. They are made to be used repeatedly for years to come. Using
                    1 ½” thick kiln-dried wood, the center of the plank is routed out to form a cooking surface. Then we
                    drill two holes through the plank on each end, and place a metal bolt running through the holes with
                    a knot on each end. This is done to help keep the plank from cracking; or if it does crack to help hold
                    it together so it can be used for years.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>BBQ Planks</strong> – Have similar benefits to that of the baking plank, in addition the BBQ planks add
                    incredible flavor to the foods cooked on them-from the woodsy flavored cedar oils to the rich smoke from
                    the charred edges and bottom. They, too, maintain natural moisture in the foods cooked on them. Our BBQ
                    planks are made from clear Western red cedar. BBQ planks are designed to be used on your BBQ and are
                    intended to be used one time.

                <header>BAKING PLANK – USE, CARE, HANDLING &amp; CLEANING</header>
                <p>
                    Before using your plank for the first time it is best to oil the entire plank with an inexpensive vegetable oil. Using a
                    paper towel, rub oil over the entire plank front, back, sides, and the cooking surface. Remove any excess
                    oil with a clean paper towel. You only need to oil the plank once. The oil will help maintain the beauty
                    of the natural woods and keep it from staining. After oiling it is ready for use.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Baking planks never need to be soaked in water. They are to be used in your home oven. The oven should always be pre-heated
                    to between 375° to 425º depending on the recipe. You will always use the oven in baking mode, never on
                    the broiler. The plank should always be placed in the center of the oven on the metal rack. If your plank
                    has a slight crack, it can be placed on a cookie sheet to ensure none of the juices flow onto the oven's
                    surface. It is best to use a conventional oven. A convection oven can be used, but the whirling hot air
                    can lead to a splitting or cracking of the plank.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After use, baking planks should be washed with warm water and dish soap. I like to use the orange and yellow Tuffy™ pad to
                    remove any baked on juices or seasoning. Rinse with hot water and let the plank air dry. Place in a dry
                    cupboard until next use.
                </p>

            <section class="page-section">
                <header>BBQ PLANK – USE, CARE, HANDLING &amp; CLEANING</header>
                <p>
                    Before using your BBQ planks they must be soaked through completely. This can be done by placing them in a 2” deep baking
                    pan. Then cover them with water. Place a paper weight or a coffee cup filled with water on top of the
                    planks to keep them submerged. The planks will be sufficiently soaked in approximately 1-1 ½ hours, but
                    can continue to soak as long as you want until you are ready to use them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    BBQ Planks are best for gas BBQ grills. The wood adds flavor and the BBQ planks will char on the bottom and smoke adding
                    a great smoke flavor, too. Pre-heat your gas grill on high for 5-10 minutes until red hot. Remove the
                    planks from the water and pat dry with a paper towel. Place the fish, meat, or other items on the plank,
                    leaving room around the edges and in-between the items so they will cook evenly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Place the planks on the grill, turn the gas grill down to medium-high, cover, and cook until the foods are cooked to the
                    desired temperature. Check periodically about every 3 minutes to ensure the planks have not caught on
                    fire. If the edges are on fire, just spray them with a little water, cover the grill and continue to
                    cook. Once the planks have caught on fire you will need to check them every 1-2 minutes and spray them
                    to stop the fire.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When the food has finished cooking the planks will be completely charred on the bottom side, with an un-charred top side
                    except around the edges. If the planks are heavily charred remove carefully from the grill with a pair
                    of strong tongs and a metal spatula to ensure the plank is stable. Place the planks on a cookie sheet
                    and serve directly from the plank, or remove the food from the planks, place on a serving tray, and serve.
                </p>
                <p>
                    BBQ Planks can be used on a charcoal grill if desired. The charcoal fire should be turning gray and no flames should be evident
                    before proceeding to cook with the planks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If used properly…BBQ planks are made to be used once and discarded, although some people claim they have used them several
                    times before needing to discard, while others say they break them up and use with the charcoal the next
                    time they BBQ.

                <header>FAQs</header>
                <p>
                    <strong>Why doesn’t the baking plank catch on fire in the oven?</strong> The oven never gets hot enough to reach
                    the flash-point of the wood. By following the recipes and keeping the cooking temperatures at 425°or
                    below, unless the planks make contact with an oven element they will not catch on fire in the oven.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>How long do you have to soak the baking plank before use?</strong> Trick question…you don’t ever have
                    to soak the baking plank-they are used as they are, no soaking necessary.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Why do the baking planks help keep moisture in the foods that are cooked on them?</strong> When you bake
                    on a glass, porcelain, or metal dish, that dish conducts heat and becomes the same temperature as the
                    oven it's in. The planks don’t conduct heat so the foods roast from the top, but never cook from the
                    bottom. That is why you never see any burnt juices on the bottom of a plank like you do with pans that
                    conduct heat; all the natural juices stay inside the foods.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Can I use my baking plank on the BBQ grill?</strong> Sure you can…I don’t recommend it, as it is much
                    more difficult to maintain the proper heat levels, and it is possible that you could catch your expensive
                    baking plank on fire. Just use the BBQ planks-they are easy and cheap.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Do I need separate baking planks for fish, meat, vegetables, or dessert recipes?</strong>
                    No, you really only need one plank for any of these things. You may need two or more if you want to cook for several people.
                    But the natural oils in the plank don’t allow it to absorb flavors, so you can use the same plank for
                    salmon as you would for the apple dessert-just be sure to clean the plank properly between uses.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Why can’t I just use a cedar roofing shake, or a cedar fence board to cook on?
                    </strong> You probably could, but there are problems with some of these options. First, you need to make
                    sure that the wood has never been chemically treated-you could poison someone. Second, the cedar shakes
                    and fence boards are not the exact size you need. Shakes are thin on one end and thick on the other,
                    and make for an uneven cooking. The fence boards are too thick. The BBQ planks have been designed to
                    allow enough heat to come through to cook the food properly without burning through.
